## Kinematic Analysis of Human Movement

### Gait and Standing Long Jump

Computational implementation of the kinematic analysis of human movements. In particular, in this repository, a multibody biomechanical analysis is performed to study the gait cycle and the standing long jump.

The methods and pipeline used are extensively described in the ***report.pdf*** file.

### Code:

 For our kinematic analysis implementation:

1) Run script ***Preprocessing.m***. A choice window will pop up and the ***gait.xlsx*** or the ***jump.xlsx*** should be picked. The ***static.xlsx*** should not be run, since it runs automatically in both cases.

2) Run ***KinematicAnalysis.m***. A choice window will pop up and the ***BiomechanicalModel_gait.txt*** or the ***BiomechanicalModel_jump.txt*** should be picked.

Note that for each of these steps, the choice of the aforementioned files will lead to the analysis of the respective motion. For the analysis of the alternative file, please repeat the steps for the other files. All the files mentioned are inside the Computational Implementation directory.
